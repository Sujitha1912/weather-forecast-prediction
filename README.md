## To predict weather forecasts(1-5 days) for consumers.
As you might expect, data and data analytics rule in generating weather forecast success.
The accuracy of weather forecasts depends on the quality and quantity of data that is available.
For temperature forecasts, AccuWeather was the most accurate for wind and precipitation forecasts and high-temperature forecasts.
While The Weather Channel was the most accurate for the low-temperature forecast.

## Problem Statement
As a new intern of ForecastWatch, to design, implement and present from a sample data warehouse to show its model and applications to a media client in Dallas who want to use your data in the local TV news.

## Challenges
### Data Collection
To predict the weather is limited by three factors: 
the amount of available data; 
the time available to analyze it;
the complexity of weather events.
### Data Cleaning
To clean unnecessary attributes that were not required for the model.
Converting Data Types to the desired Format.
### Data Modeling
To create the correct ETLs
### Data Prediction
To predict the correct formula for the future forecast.

## Outcomes
Our predicted weather forecast value is 
52 % matching with NOAA.
